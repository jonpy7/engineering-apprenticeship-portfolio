# Engineering Apprenticeship Portfolio – Jon Batista

This repository contains a curated set of projects demonstrating my
software engineering fundamentals, problem-solving approach, and
readiness for an engineering apprenticeship in a production environment.

My background includes data engineering and analytics, and I am
intentionally pursuing an apprenticeship to deepen my core software
engineering skills, including writing maintainable code, working with
distributed systems, and collaborating on production-quality software.
